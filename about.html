    <title>About Me</title>
    
<p> Hi, my name is Grenville Paynter but people call me Gren. I am a sophomore her at URI studying business. This class is pretty interesting to me so I may change my major, maybe not. I am from Newtown, Connecticut and went to school at Newtown High. I have a sister who is a Junior at Uconn studying mechanical engineering. At home I have two cats and a dog named Otis. For free time I find myself hanging out with friends or trying to stayed entertained. I am a fan of the New York Giants who have been close to my heart for all my life. <strong>Danny Dimes baby!!</strong> In the right pictureI am playing football for my highschool team. I loved to play football in highschool from how I was always with my friends and having a good time. Making this website was a ton of fun. If you want to contact me, my email is paynterg@uri.edu.</p>

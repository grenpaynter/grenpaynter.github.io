 <p> Welcome to my final project for CSC 106. My partner and I decided to make a mini game where you have control a figure and dodge falling balls. In order to beat the game, you have to complete a total of 3 levels. The first level, we start you off at slower speeds so the player can understand the game. As the player progress' through the levels, the speed increases which also increases difficulty. 
      
     Give it a try !!</p>
